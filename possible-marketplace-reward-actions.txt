Suggestion/Idea - Could we offer points or equivalent that are rewarded when you take some type of action within the marketplace?

For example:
Listing a nft on eth - 5 Points (Would have a cap or limit per day/week/month) 
Listing a nft on poly - 2 Points (Would have a cap or limit per day/week/month) 
Purchased a nft - 50 points
Sold a NFT - 25 points
Placed a collection offer - 1 point
Collection offer accepted - 10 points per party
Claimed TAP rewards - 2 points
Weekly points for holding Alpha Shared related projects - X points
Bunch of things here and the above are just examples. This can be used to increase engagement and get folks excited about using Alpha shares Marketplace.

In the future these points could be redeemed for an airdrop or claim of Alpha token, USDC, or native chain token.
